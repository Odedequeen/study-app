# React + Vite

## My Notes

QUESTION 1
WHAT IS VITE?

ANSWERS- Vite is (pronounced veet) is a build tool used for modern web development

WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
When you build websites or web apps (especially with JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, Svelte), you need a tool that:

- Runs your app locally
- Refreshes the page automatically when you change code
- Bundles/compiles your code for production
- Makes your site faster and optimized

Vite does all this — and very fast.
It’s known for speed, simplicity, and modern features.

WHY DEVELOPERS LIKE VITE:

- Very fast startup
- Easy to use
- Works perfectly with React, Vue, etc.

Hot Reloading (it updates the browser immediately when you change code)

# QUESTION 2 -WHAT IS NPM?

NPM means Node Package Manager.

It is a tool that helps you:

- Install JavaScript libraries/packages
- Update or remove packages
- Manage dependencies for your project
- Run project scripts (like npm start, npm run dev)

- Think of NPM like:
  A store where you download tools for your project.

- Example: you type on your terminal
- (npm install react) and press enter

# QUESTION 3-y WHAT IS PACKAGE.JSON?

package.json is a file inside your project.

ASSISGNMENT TO COMPLETA OUT REACT DECEMBSR PROJECT

1. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

You break UI into components (like building blocks), each reusable and focused on one part of the UI.

Components are usually functions that return UI descriptions using JSX (a syntax like HTML inside JavaScript).

React updates the screen efficiently by tracking changes and only updating what’s necessary.

Main ideas

Components = reusable UI pieces

State = data that can change inside a component

Props = inputs passed into components

Hooks let function components use React features like state.

2. React Hooks Cheatsheet (freeCodeCamp & others)

What Hooks

Hooks are special functions in React that let you use features like state, effects, context, etc. inside function components.

Key Hooks

useState → track and update state

useEffect → run side effects after rendering (e.g., fetch data)

KEY DIFFERENCES (VERY CLEAR)
Item	What it controls	How you interact
React	The whole UI structure	Automatically
React Hooks	Data & behavior	Inside React
DOM	Page structure	Manually
DOM Elements	Buttons, text, images	Directly
